# My Weather APP in React - Updated

It's a **basic Weather App**, based on React framework. The app is an improvement of my final project for **SheCodes React course**.

Using **My Weather App**, you can check:

- The current weather in any city around the world through the _search bar_.
- The current weather in your location through the _Current Location button_.
- The current weather in five _"popular" cities_.
- The forecast for the _next five days_.

The app is more responsive that [App V1](https://boisterous-pavlova-007952.netlify.app/) and has more funcionalities compared to [App V2](https://gregarious-sunflower-a9590a.netlify.app/). Additionally, unit convertion is working for temperature in **current weather** and **forecast**.

Let me know if you have any questions or comments :)
