# My Weather APP in React - Updated

It's a basic Weather App, based on React framework. The App is an improvement of my final project for SheCodes React course.

Using My Weather App, you can check:

- The current weather in any city around the world through the search bar.
- The current weather in your location through the Current Location button.
- The current weather in five "popular" cities.
- The forecast for the next five days.

The app is more responsive that [App V1](https://boisterous-pavlova-007952.netlify.app/) and has more funcionalities compared to [App V2](https://gregarious-sunflower-a9590a.netlify.app/). Additionally, unit convertion is working for temperature in **current weather** and **forecast**.

Let me know if you have any questions or comments :)
