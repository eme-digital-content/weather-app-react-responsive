# My Weather APP in React - SheCodes React

It's a **basic Weather App**, based on the React framework. The app is an improvement of my final project for the **SheCodes React** course.

Using **My Weather App**, you can check:

- The current weather in any city around the world through the _search bar_.
- The current weather in your location through the _Current Location button_.
- The current weather in five _"popular" cities_.
- The forecast for the _next five days_.

The app is more responsive that [App V1](https://github.com/eme-digital-content/weather-app-local-basic) and has more funcionalities compared to [App V2](https://github.com/eme-digital-content/my-react-weather-app-final). Additionally, unit convertion is working for temperature in **current weather** and **forecast**.
